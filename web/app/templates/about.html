            I am currently a software engineer at Figure Technologies. Figure is a financial 
            technology company leveraging blockchain, AI and analytics to deliver products to 
            improve the financial lives of our customers. We create innovative products for 
            consumers and a blockchain protocol that enhances the origination, custody, trading 
            and securitization of assets for institutions.</p>
            
            <p>
            I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Montana State University in mechanical
            engineering and computer science respectively. During my graduate program I was a member of
            the Numerical Intelligent Systems Lab where we focus on applying machine learning, mathematics, 
            and software engineering to solve a variety of problems. My research focused on developing 
            techniques to assess the health of large volumes of fruits and vegetables using a combination 
            of hyper-spectral imaging and machine learning.</p>
            
            <p>
            In the past I have worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I applied computational
            techniques to monitor the health of a variety of structures. I also spent
            time working in the computational fluid dynamics field developing new algorithms
            and visualizations.</p>
            
            <p>
            I also worked as an intern at Blackmore Sensors & Analytics (now part of Aurora), where I 
            developed software for automotive lidar systems.</p>
